# Core Beliefs: Agent-First Engineering

Operating principles extracted from agent-first development at scale (~1M LOC, 1,500 PRs, 0 manually-written code).

---

## 1. AGENTS.md Is a Table of Contents, Not an Encyclopedia

Keep the root doc short (~100 lines). It maps questions to files. Deep knowledge lives in `docs/`, mechanically enforced.

## 2. Knowledge Must Be Mechanically Discoverable

Agents can't ask clarifying questions mid-run the way humans can. Every convention, constraint, and decision must be written down in a structured, findable location. If it's not in the repo, it doesn't exist.

## 3. Progressive Disclosure Over Monolithic Docs

Don't front-load everything. Point agents to the right doc at the right time. A short pointer in AGENTS.md → detailed doc in `docs/` → code examples in the codebase.

## 4. Plans Are First-Class Artifacts

Plans live in `docs/plans/`, not in chat history. They are reviewed, versioned, and moved to `docs/plans/complete/` when done. This creates an audit trail and prevents duplicated work.

## 5. Quality Is Measured, Not Assumed

Use `docs/quality-score.md` to grade domains. Scores are reviewed regularly. Quality must not regress — if a change worsens a score, it needs justification or a remediation plan.

## 6. Tech Debt Is Tracked, Not Ignored

Every known shortcut, workaround, or "TODO" gets logged in `docs/tech-debt-tracker.md` with severity and a remediation path. Invisible debt compounds; visible debt gets fixed.

## 7. No Tribal Knowledge

If a decision was made in Slack, a meeting, or a conversation — it must be encoded into `docs/` before it can be acted on. The repo is the single source of truth for all project knowledge.

## 8. Validate at Boundaries, Trust Internals

Validate aggressively at system boundaries (user input, external APIs, network). Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Don't over-validate between trusted components.

## 9. Tests Prove Behavior, Not Implementation

Write tests that verify what the system does, not how it does it. Tests should survive refactors. If changing internal structure breaks tests, the tests are wrong.

## 10. Docs Ship With Code

Documentation is not a follow-up task. If behavior changes, docs change in the same commit. Outdated docs are worse than no docs — they actively mislead.
